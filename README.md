# Movie Ticket Project

## Description
The movie ticket system will allow the user to view all available movies through the menu and give them the option to choose from the available dates, times, and location of where they would like to watch the movie. Once they have chosen the location and date/time the user would then move on to choosing the number of people going such as the number of adults, children or seniors. They would then be asked to choose where they would like to sit and the system would give them the seats. Finally, they would get their ticket at the end of the session with more details.

## Manual
When starting the program, the user will be presented will a list of movies from which they can choose one. The program will ask the user to enter the number of the movie from that list and then bring up more details of the movie such as the title, date it premiered, rating and runtime. Another list will come up showing the user to choose which theater they would like to watch it from and enter their choice. The user would then choose from one of the available times and later the number of adult, child and senior tickets them would like.
